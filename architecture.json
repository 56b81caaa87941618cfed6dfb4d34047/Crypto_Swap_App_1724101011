The AI confirmed this by noting that it would replace existing content with the Uniswap-style component. The user provided specifications that included a request for popular token choices. The AI subsequently proposed additional features for the project, such as advanced filtering options, a favorites section, a price chart, a swap history, tooltips for token information, and a comparison feature for token performance, indicating the completion of certain tasks like the swap history and tooltips. The user was then posed a couple of questions regarding whether to mirror Uniswap's design or incorporate unique elements, and whether the popular tokens list should update dynamically based on market trends or remain static. The AI summarized these queries and continued to acknowledge the user's requests, stating it would implement a live price feed, a real-time gas fee estimator, and asked the user to provide additional details about the project for better assistance.\nAI: Understood, implementing hero section with newsletter form using Tailwind's purple theme.\nAI: Got it, incorporating glassmorphism styles with purple shades.\nUser: add glassmorphism styles with purple shades\nAI: Noted, we are developing another component that includes lending options.\nUser: add another component with lending options\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: add a hero section below the top nav bar with a big form for adding your email and address to a newsletter. make it beautiful with tailwind (purple theme)"

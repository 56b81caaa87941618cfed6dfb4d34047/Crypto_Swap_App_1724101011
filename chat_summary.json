The user was also offered a checklist of additional features they might want to implement, such as a live price feed, price impact warning for large trades, and a real-time gas fee estimator, noting which features were checked or unchecked. The AI again confirmed its intent to add the Uniswap-style component and subsequently asked the user for more details about the project.",

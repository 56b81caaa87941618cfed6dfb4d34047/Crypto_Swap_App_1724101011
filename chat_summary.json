Initially, the user requested the addition of a separate component for lending options, which the AI confirmed it would work on. The user was then presented with questions regarding the integration of lending features and was asked for preferences on the user interface for buy and sell forms, emphasizing usability for new users versus complexity for experienced traders.\n\nSubsequently, the user specified a desire for a Uniswap-style buy and sell form that includes dropdowns for popular crypto tokens. The AI acknowledged this request and confirmed it would develop a component with dropdowns featuring placeholder popular tokens. Following this, additional features were discussed, including real-time price charts, transaction history, and a favorites section. The user expressed specific interests in ensuring that the popular tokens list is dynamically updated based on market trends rather than being hardcoded.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, the user insisted on replacing existing content with the Uniswap-style component and reiterated their preferences regarding token selection features, prompting further questions about search functionality and the token list's update process. After acknowledging the requests, the AI proposed to add essential features like live price feeds and price impact warnings, while also seeking clarification on the overall project scope from the user.",
